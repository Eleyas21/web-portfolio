        <h2>Dream Big</h2>
        <h3>Become Number 1 Web Developer</h3>
        <p>
            Becoming a web developer is a rewarding career that offers great scope for opportunity and progression. And, luckily enough, if you are based in London or the South-East, there are many companies that offer web design in Essex that are always on the lookout for more talent. 
            This career is all about skill, and there isn’t any need to gain a degree or associated qualification. We’re not saying that you shouldn’t study this area of work, but most web developers are self-taught.
